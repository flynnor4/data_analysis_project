## **_Define the research question._**

1. What is the distribution of per capita sales across geographies? 
    -  What are the ranks of the top 10 geographies for per capita consumption across every liquor category? 
    -  Are there any outliers that have high per capita sales in only one specific liquor category?


## **_Define decision maker and the decision to be made._**

**<ins>Decision maker:<ins>** Senior VP of Distribution and  Logistics for Iowa Beverage, a beer, wine, and spirit distribution company that serves the state of Iowa.

**<ins>Decision:<ins>** The Senior VP wants to know the regions with the highest per capita liquor sales and the types of liquor purchased to decide inventory needs for the 2025-26 fiscal year. 


## **_Provide a short description of the nature of the provided data set and explain how these characteristics affect your analysis methodology._**

**<ins>Iowa Liquor Sales:<ins>** Iowa liquor sales data is collected by the Iowa Department of Revenue. The dataset pertains specifically to businesses with Class “E” liquor licenses, that is, grocery stores, 
liquor stores, and other entities that sell alcohol for off-premises consumption. The data is organized by product, date of purchase from January 1, 2012 to present, liquor type, product type, and stores, 
facilitating analysis of liquor sales for specific geographies over time [Iowa.gov](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy/about_data). 

**<ins>American Community Survey (ACS):<ins>** The ACS is a survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau that continuously collects nationally representative demographic, socioeconomic, and housing data.
Such data facilitates governmental programmatic initiatives and allows for cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of trends across communities, states, regions, and sociodemographic groups [CMS.gov](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/sgm-clearinghouse-acs.pdf). 


## **_Briefly propose the tools and methods used to perform the analysis._**

We will use GitHub as a repository for our work. All data transformations, analyses, and visualizations will be conducted using R. 
We will use the repository to collaborate on building the code and sharing our interpretations for the final report. Once we have completed the analyses and visualizations, 
we will begin collaboratively drafting the report in an R markdown file, including interpretations of all analyses and visualizations. Once the report is completed, we will 
record the presentation using Zoom to present each section.
